title: Dissertation materials available on github

The contents of my dissertation, including data, code, and the document itself,
 are or will be made [available on github](https://github.com/christopherahern/dissertation).
The openness and generosity of other researchers made things possible, so I'd like to do my
best to follow that example. 

I'm currently reorganizing and cleaning things up, but feel free to contact me with any 
questions or comments!
