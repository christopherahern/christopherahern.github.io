title: Upcoming presentation at FWAV

I'm excited to say Akiva Bacovcin and I will be presenting our paper
*The logistic language learning curve?* at [FWAV](http://fwav3.commons.gc.cuny.edu/program/). 
We'll be presenting on the second day (Thursday, May 19th). Looking forward to it!

> The logistic function, which has long served as the basic model of discrete
language change (cf. Altmann et al. 1983; Kroch 1989), has both deep connections to
change in biological populations as well as a practical implementation in terms of logistic
regression. However, no particular cognitive mechanism has been proposed to underlie
the logistic (Kroch 1989, 4). Yang’s (2002) variational learning model offers a cognitive
basis for change insofar as its mean dynamics yield S-shaped curves. Indeed, using
simulations, we show that given sufficiently large datasets, it is possible to gain insight
into whether the learning or logistic model generated an empirical S-shaped curve.
