title: Upcoming presentation at FWAV
---

I'm excited to say that some work I've been doing with Akiva Bacovcin has been 
accepted to [FWAV](http://fwav3.commons.gc.cuny.edu/program/). We'll be presenting
on the second day (Thursday, May 19th). Looking forward to it!

> The logistic function, which has long served as the basic model of discrete
language change (cf. Altmann et al. 1983; Kroch 1989), has both deep connections to
change in biological populations as well as a practical implementation in terms of logistic
regression. However, no particular cognitive mechanism has been proposed to underlie
the logistic (Kroch 1989, 4). Yangâ€™s (2002) variational learning model offers a cognitive
basis for change insofar as its mean dynamics yield S-shaped curves. Indeed, using
simulations, we show that given sufficiently large datasets, it is possible to gain insight
into whether the learning or logistic model generated an empirical S-shaped curve.
