The contents of my dissertation, including data, code, and the latex document
itself, are or will be made available on github. I've benefited immensely
from the generosity and openness of other researchers, so I figured I'd do my
best to repay the favor as best I could. Reorganizing and cleaning things up
is a work in progress, but the goal is to make the analysis reproducible. Feel
free to contact me with any questions, comments, or suggestions!
