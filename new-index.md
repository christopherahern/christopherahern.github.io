I'm a data scientist at Oncora Medical where we use machine learning
and data to improve cancer treatment

I'm also an affiliated researcher  at the University of Pennsylvania
where I work with [Robin Clark](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rclark/Site/Welcome.html)
 in [Linguistics](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/) and [Josh Plotkin](http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/) in 
[Biology](http://www.bio.upenn.edu/) using computational and statistical
 tools to understand how and why languages change over time.
