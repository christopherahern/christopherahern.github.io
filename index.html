I'm a post-doctoral researcher  at the University of Pennsylvania
where I work with [Robin Clark](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rclark/Site/Welcome.html)
 in [Linguistics](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/) and [Josh Plotkin](http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/) 
in [Biology](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/). My research  focuses on using 
mathematical and statistical tools to understand how and why languages
 change over time.
