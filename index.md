I'm a data scientist at [Oncora Medical](https://oncoramedical.com/) where we use data and machine learning to
 help radiation onocologists provide the best possible care for cancer patients.

I also work with [Robin Clark](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rclark/Site/Welcome.html)
 and [Josh Plotkin](http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania
using computational and statistical tools to understand how and why languages  change over time.
