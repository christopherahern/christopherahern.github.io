I'm a data scientist at [Janus Health](https://www.janus-ai.com/) where we use machine learning to 
help doctors get paid, with the goal of making healthcare better for patients. Prior to that I
worked at [Oncora Medical](https://oncora.ai) using data and machine learning to help radiation
oncologists provide the best possible care for cancer patients.

I worked with [Robin Clark](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rclark/Site/Welcome.html)
 and [Josh Plotkin](http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania
during my PhD and Postdoc using computational and statistical tools to understand 
how and why languages  change over time.
